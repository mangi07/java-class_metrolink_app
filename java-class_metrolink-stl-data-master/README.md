# About the St. Louis com.ben.metrolink data

All of the data is compiled from the GTFS (Google Transit Feed Specification) which is a nationwide format for aggregating transit data.

The data contained in this repository was obtained by the GTFS exchange.  The last update to this repo was July 21st, 2015

## The Data

The GTFS CSV data can easily be imported into a sqlite database and embedded in the application of your choice.

If you are using the [NextMetro app](https://github.com/MoMenne/com.ben.metrolink-stl-ios), CSV files are embedded instead of an actual sqlite database.

To generate the sqlite database, run the command
```
generate_database.sh
```
This will create the database as well as populate all of the data contained in the raw directory.

To export the data to CSV, run the following command
```
export_to_csv.sh
```
This will generate all of the stop times for the St. Louis Metrolink per station.  Each station will have two files, one file representing the stop times for weekday service and the other file representing stop times for weekend service.
